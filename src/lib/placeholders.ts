      details: `To provide IISER students with a holistic, real-world understanding of how the fragrant Kewda flower is cultivated, processed into essential oils and fragrances, and how it significantly supports Ganjam’s rural economy.\n\nUnder Project Kewda, IISER students experienced end-to-end exposure to the journey of the Kewda (Pandanus fascicularis) flower—from plantation to distillation to marketable fragrance. This hands-on educational initiative took them into the famed khejda belt of Ganjam district, Odisha—home to India's Kewda industry, which accounts for nearly 90% of the country’s commercial production.\n\nParticipants learned traditional and modern steam-distillation techniques used in local bhattis (processing units), witnessing firsthand the transformation of male flower spikes into Kewda rooh, attar, and floral waters. They saw how locally-grown flowers, harvested from thorny 15–18 ft shrubs yielding 30–40 flower spikes annually, undergo labour-intensive processing in deg bhabka systems to yield precious fragrance products.\n\nThrough interactions with growers and distillers, students gained deep insight into how Kewda cultivation drives livelihoods: around 200,000 people in some 200 villages earn income from harvesting and processing, with 800 L of oil, 20,000 L of attar, and 50,000 L of floral water produced annually—generating approximately ₹120 crore in revenue.
